        "relies on a Q-Table, a tabular data structure that stores values representing the expected utility of",
        "taking specific actions in each possible state. The Q-Table helps the learning agent make decisions",
        "by providing a way to evaluate which actions lead to more favorable outcomes over time.",

        "In this implementation, key parameters like learning rate and discount factor control how the",
        "agent updates its understanding of the environment. The learning rate (learningRate in",

        "discount factor (discount) influences how future rewards are valued relative to immediate ones.",

        "The configuration allows for the generation of a specified number of training examples (or",

        "goals, start positions, and locked elements are defined, guiding the agentâ€™s training process.",
        "The settings in config.json define these learning conditions, providing a structured approach to",
